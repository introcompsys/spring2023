1. Read the notes. If you have any questions, post an issue on the course website repo. 
1. Using your terminal, download your KWL repo . Include the command used in your badge PR. 
2. Try using setting up git using your favorite IDE or GitHub Desktop. Make a file {index}`gitoffline.md` and include some notes of how it went. Was it hard? easy? what did you figure out or get stuck on. 
1. Reorganize a folder on your computer ( good candidate may be  desktop or downloads folder), using only a terminal to make new directories, move files, check what's inside them, etc. Answer reflection questions (will be in notes) in a new file, `terminal.md` in your kwl repo.
Start with a file explorer open, but then try to close it and use only command line tools to explore and make your choices. If you get stuck, look up additional commands to do acomplish your goals.  

```markdown
### Terminal File moving reflection
1. Did this get easier toward the end? Yes, it did get easier towards the end
3. Use the `history` to see which commands you used and how many times each, make a table below.
Couldn't make a table in git
5. Did you have to look up how to do anything we had not done in class?  No, you explain the instructions in perfect detail
6. When do you think that using the terminal will be better than using your GUI file explorer?
  Managing files and directories
7. What questions/challenges/ relfections do you have after this? For terminal, I wonder if any other processes like debugging or building will effect compile and executing the code in the terminal
8. What kinds of things might you want to write a bash script for given what you know in bash so far? come up with 1-2 scenarios
Automated backups: You may want to write a bash script to automate the backup process of your files or databases. The script can be scheduled to run at regular intervals and create backups of specific directories or databases, compress them, and store them in a secure location. This will save you time and effort, and ensure that your data is always backed up in case of any unexpected events.

File management: You can write a bash script to automate file management tasks, such as renaming, copying, or deleting files. For instance, you can write a script that renames all the files in a directory to lowercase, or copies all the files with a specific extension to a different directory. This can save you time and ensure consistency in your file naming conventions.
