1. Describe a type of project where it would be worth it for you to learn a language you have never used before in {index}`newlanguage.md` This should be based in what types of features for the language your project would require and/or what would contribute to the long term health of the project.
1. Try out/learn about one of the following languages that you have not used before, do something small that is typical of that language (eg a toy data analysis in R): [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started), [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/).  Try to use official documentation only to figure out a toy task to do.  Answer the following questions in {index}`languagelearning.md`:

    ```
    1. What is this language designed for?
    1. What Programming paradigm(s) does it support?
    1. What language would make it easy to learn this language? Why?
    1. What language would make it hard for someone to learn this language? Why?
    1. What is its most unique feature(s)?
    1. Include your small code bit (with comments!)
    1. How was it trying to figure out this langauge
    ```
