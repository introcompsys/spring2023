short: examine a project, install hw simulator, map knowledge
---
1. Examine a large project you have done or by finding an open source project on GitHub.  Answer the reflection questions in `software.md` in your kwl repo. (will be in notes)
2. map out how you think about data moving through a small program and bring it with you to class (no need to submit)




```markdown
## Software Reflection

1. link to public repo if applicable or title of your project
1. What types of files are there that are not code?
1. What different types of code files are in the project? Do they serve different goals?
1. Is it all in one language or are there multiple?
1. Try to figure out (remember) how the project works. What types of things, without running the code can you look at at a high level?
```
