Free. You may do the following as a bonus practice badge though. 

1. Write a C program to compare values as doubles and as float (single precision/32bit) to see that this comparison issue is related to the IEEE standard and is not language specific.  Make notes and comparison around its behavior and include it in a code cell in  `cdouble.md`
