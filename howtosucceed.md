-For any students that take this course my advice for them is to make sure you take the first couple of weeks to really develop a better understanding of github and how to use github as the course is taught over github and if you don't know how github works you will fall behind. I also suggest going to office hours to help learn about github, badges, pull requests and more. This will help out so much as you won't have to spend hours of your time struggling to teach yourself how github works.
