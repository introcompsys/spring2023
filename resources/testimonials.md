# Testimonials from spring 2023 students

Advice for future students taking this course is to do the homework the same day, and if you get stuck, go to office hours. If the office hours don't work for you, try talking to the TA's or the professor and you will most likely be able to meet one on one with a schedule that fits both of you.
