# Testimonials from spring 2023 students

I would suggest doing every badge you can in the beginning of the semester so you don't have to play catch up in the end. Also, the badges are much easier to complete if you have just covered the material in class. Try to make a plan for what badges you plan on doing and when in the beginning of the semester and sticking to that so you know what grad eyou plan on getting and how you want to go about the course.

I would suggest doing every badge onces you are assigned it so you can stay up to day and not fall behind while you are in class. As well as asking questiosn and clarfying thoes questio with TA and TA hours if you get confused. As well as seting a goal for yoru inital grade that you want.
